# Workshop Tutorial

## Workshop Materials
Friends from [Underscore](http://underscore.io) have created and donated the curriculum. Rather than lecture-based, this hands-on workshop is designed for self-paced learning. Mentors will be floating around, engaging and facilitating students in their learning.

## Creative Scala Tutorial
ScalaBridge Workshop uses [Creative Scala Tutorial](http://creativescala.org/creative-scala.html).

## Creative Scala Template
The Creative Scala template used in this tutorial is [here](https://github.com/underscoreio/creative-scala-template).
