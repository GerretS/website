One small step in code, one giant leap for contribution! Today we set up the blog on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), a neat deployment and hosting platform. Now all code on the [master branch of the GitHub repo](https://github.com/scalabridge/website) will be automatically deployed to the [website](https://www.scalabridge.org/).

If you want to contribute, check out the [contribution guide](https://github.com/scalabridge/website/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) or ask on our [community Slack group](https://join.slack.com/t/scalabridge/shared_invite/enQtNTU0OTcwMjYxNTA1LTRhMDk1NjhkMTk1MTgxY2I5NjA3MDI2M2YzOTQ1N2RlZjdlYTVmODZiMjEyMDljOWFiOWQxNTk2MTVhYmQ2MWI).

Thanks for stopping by!
