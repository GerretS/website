## Reminder Email for Mentors - Day Before

#### From: $NAME

#### Subject: Tomorrow - ScalaBridge $LOCATION: Intro to Programming with Scala Workshop!

Hi all,

Thanks again for helping out as a mentor!

The workshop starts at **$TIME**. At $TIME, we will have a short opening, where mentors will introduce themselves. Please be there for the introduction.

- Install Bundle:

   At the beginning of the workshop, we will install [intellj-scala-bundle](https://github.com/JetBrains/intellij-scala-bundle) for setting up the dev env. It is strongly recommended that you try to install this bundle before the workshop, so that you can help the mentees to resolve issues. During the workshop, any problems related to the bundle can be asked in the $CHATROOM.

- Tutorial:
   We will be using [Creative Scala tutorial](http://creativescala.org/creative-scala.html) for teaching scala. As a mentor, you will be walking around and answer questions about Scala.

Please let me know if there are any questions/ concerns/ problems. I can be reached by email, Gitter, Twitter, and in-person.

Looking forward to seeing you all!

$NAME
