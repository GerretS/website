## Reminder Email for Mentors - Two Weeks Before

#### From: $NAME

#### Subject: $DATE: Reminder for Intro to Programming with Scala - ScalaBridge $LOCATION

Hi all,

ScalaBridge is 2 weeks away. I am excited to meet all of you!

Any info about the workshop can be found at: https://www.meetup.com/ScalaBridge-Boston/events/251183790/

I've created a Gitter channel [here]($GITTER_LINK) and have added all of you to a private mentor room.
Please let me know if you don't have access to $GITTER_MENTOR_LINK.

I've posted a few ideas on Gitter about organizing ScalaBridge this time. Please check it out. Any feedback/idea is welcome,

If you can't see Gitter discussion for some reason. Here is what I posted:

```text
We currently have about 15 mentors and lots of mentees (150 registered,
 I am not sure how many will show up. Usually the no show rate is about 50%).

The optimal ratio is 5:1. So we're a little bit short of mentors.
 If you have friends/ coworkers, who are interested in coming,
  please let me know.

Since we are a little short of mentors, I want to try something new this time.
Many people want to help but can't show up in $LOCATION.
I am thinking about adding them to a QA channel on Gitter,
so that if we don't have enough onsite mentors, mentees can
ask questions online.

We could have two concurrent sessions (a. mentees going through
 tutorials online and mentors walking around to answer questions.
  b. mentors, who are interested in doing a tech presentation,
  can give talks about Scala related stuff). ------- This will
  split people into two "group". For example, if we have 1 mentor
  presenting, and 30 students listening. Then the rest of the mentors
  can still go around and help the rest of the students who are not
  listening to the talk. Mentors, who are not presenting, can have a
  more balanced load.

Let me know your thoughts about the ideas above. Or if you have any
recommendations on anything, please feel free to post it in this channel!
Looking forward to meeting you all! :)

```

Best,

$NAME
