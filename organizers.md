# ScalaBridge Workshop

ScalaBridge workshops are intended for people from underrepresented populations who are interested in learning Scala.

**Note: You do not have to be a woman to be underrepresented in tech. Diversity comes in many forms: race, gender, age, religion, culture, sexual orientation, socioeconomic background, etc. If at any point, you feel excluded from any ScalaBridge event, please do not hesitate to reach out to [@ScalaBridge](https://twitter.com/ScalaBridge).**

## What is a ScalaBridge workshop?
ScalaBridge workshops are usually one-day long events, which will take students through the basics of functional programming in Scala using the Creative Scala tutorial. By the end of the workshop, students will have built several "doodles" using Creative Scala and have a basic understanding of functional programming and Scala fundamentals.

## How to organize a ScalaBridge workshop?
It is not difficult at all to become a workshop organizer. Simply follow the following steps:

1. [ Find A Date for The Workshop (3 months before the workshop date) ](/find-date)
2. [ Invite Mentors (3 months before) ](/invite-mentors)
3. [ Find Sponsorship: Food & Space (3 months before) ](/sponsorship)
4. [ Promote The Event (2/ 3 months before) ](/promote-workshop)
5. [ Event Reminders (1 month before) ](/event-reminders)
6. [ Workshop Day ](/workshop-day)
7. [ Post Workshop (1 day after) ](/post-workshop)

A ScalaBridge workshop can be associated with a conference, or it can happen independently. The recommended time to start the above process for organizing the event is 3 months before the event date.

The above process is recommended, however, not required. You're welcome to follow your own steps if you prefer.
