# Event Reminders

**Optimal start time of this step: 1 month before the workshop**

## Why send out reminders?
One of the best ways to ensure that you have a reasonable turnout for the workshop is to remind students and mentors about the event repeatedly. Keep in mind that the usual turnout for the workshop is 50% of the people who registered. (Some people who did not register may also show up.)

## Who to remind?
1. Students
2. Mentors

Reminder emails should be sent out separately for the two different groups.

## One Month Before the event:
You would want to remind people of the workshop to ensure that they can still attend, or, to remind them to update their RSVP if they can no longer attend.

### What should be included in your reminder email?
1. Students

   Remind registered students of:
   - Event date, time
   - Schedule
   - Goal of the workshop
   - Update RSVP if no longer can attend
   - (optional) Mention/ thank sponsor
   - Your contact info for questions

   **To see a sample student reminder email. Please see [here](/assets/reminder-students-one-month).**

2. Mentors:

   Remind registered mentors of:
   - Registration
   - Event date, time
   - Schedule
   - Goal of the workshop, what are they expected to do (how to help students)
   - Workshop flow
   - (optional) Suggestions for mentorship if any
   - Your contact info for questions

## Two weeks before the event:
In addition to reminding people of the event, you should finalize the number of people who signed up for the event. Give the final head count to the sponsor so they can be ready with space and food.
You will also want to give a heads up to your mentors about what to expect on the workshop day.


1. Mentors:
   - Link to event page (schedule, time, location, etc.)
   - Updates
   - Groups to join (e.g.: mentor gitter channel)
   - How many students to expect
   - Technical background of students

   - Update RSVP if no longer can attend
   - Registration time (Be prepared that people will show up late)
   - Location and transportation details (public transit or parking)
