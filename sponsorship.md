# Find Sponsorship

**Optimal start time of this step: 3 months before the workshop**

The sponsor of a ScalaBridge workshop provides food and space on the day of the event.

## How to find a sponsor/ company?

Many companies are very willing to help out with such an event. Please do not hesitate to reach out. There are a few ways of reaching out:

1. Your Wonderful Employer

   Perhaps the easiest is to ask your own employer. Talk with your coworkers and the designated event organizer to see if they are willing to provide food and space.


2. Local Meetup Email List

   Send out an email to meetup groups is also another good way to reach out to companies. Many of them will respond.

3. Twitter

   Post that you're looking for sponsorships on Twitter, and DM ScalaBridge on Twitter([@scalabridge](https://twitter.com/scalabridge)).

For people who are relatively new to the community and who are new to organizing Bridge events, here are [a list of sponsors](/sponsors), who are interested in sponsoring. Feel free to reach out to them for the workshop.

## What to do when you find a sponsor?

**It is important to communicate and share your expectations with the company before moving on to the next steps.**

1. The first step is to make sure that the sponsor/ company understands they role at the event. As a sponsor, they will provide food and space for the workshop day. You can then discuss with the company about the details, including what types of food, how much to prepare, when do you have the space until, etc.

2. Share the event date with the company to make sure that they understand when to host.

3. Share the expected size of the crowd, ideally 2 weeks before the workshop day. See [event reminders - 2 weeks before the workshop](/event-reminders) for details.

4. Talk about what type of food to prepare, (e.g. vegetarian, gluten free, kosher, etc.)

5. Visit the site if you can. Become familiar with the space. You should:
    - Make sure it is big enough to host for the size of the crowd that you're hoping for
    - Make sure it has enough tables/ chairs
    - Make sure it has enough space for people to split into groups.

## Next Step:

- We will discuss how to promote the workshop [here](/promote-workshop).
- Go back to the [main page](/organizers).
