## Overview
ScalaBridge workshops are intended to teach people from underrepresented populations programming using the [Scala programming language](https://scala-lang.org).

**Note: You do not have to be a woman to be underrepresented in tech. Diversity comes in many forms: race, gender, age, religion, culture, sexual orientation, socioeconomic background, etc. If at any point, you feel excluded from any ScalaBridge event, please do not hesitate to reach out to [ScalaBridge Organization](mailto:scalabridge@gmail.com).**

## Quick Start

The following install instruction is written based on the [jekyll Doc](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/).
